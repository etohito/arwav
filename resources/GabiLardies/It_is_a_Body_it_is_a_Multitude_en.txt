Think of the haystack in the sunshine - a body of parts, think of society - a body of parts, of yourself - as a part. And everything moving, either with deliberation or with the tides, with the way things are. I stand still, I listen, I try to learn, and I try to spread - ways of being: against the imperialist, ableist, heteronormative, patriarchal, white-supremacist, capitalist machine. Maybe I open a window and let the smell of the ocean into the factory.

The ability to envisage change and a different world requires an understanding of how the present was constructed. Walter Benjamin sees the public as occupying an \"empty time,\" with the dominant elite creating a narrative of both progress and homogenisation of the present. [1] Similarly, Debord writes about the \"eternal present\" created by the media overload of the spectacle society.[2] The present and future are seen as an inevitable continuation of the status quo. Without actively remembering, we cannot understand our society in relation to, and as a product of history and change.[3] Howard Zinn writes, \"We forget how often we have been astonished by the sudden crumbling of institutions, by extraordinary changes in people’s thoughts, by unexpected eruptions of rebellion against tyrannies, by the quick collapse of systems of power that seemed invincible.\"[4] Without history, we forget change is possible and our own power to create it - we move as a compliant body, the direction our oppressors have chosen for us (for themselves).

Archives and academia safely store and create information, but their content is seen mostly, or only, by \"those already motivated to access them and aware of how to do so.\"[5] Žižek's notion of interpassivity, as the opposite to interactivity, states that through our relationships with objects, we can relieve ourselves of action and responsibility. Žižek's example of storing films on VCR, \"the VCR is in a way watching them for me\" can be translated to historical archives.[6] The archive becomes a way to outsource remembering, to delegate care and knowledge to a repository where it becomes passive. A body of knowledge, stays still, stored, forgotten, words quiet. A body so powerful.

The gallery, or an artwork, can be used as a site of storage and transmission of information. Archival artists hold the impulse to \"make historical information, often lost or misplaced, physically present.\"[7] This impulse is mirrored in the activist strategy of \"documenting and leaking\" to make injustice and oppression visible.[8] Through the spreading of information, extracted from archives, or research, an engaged artist can \"unveil non or less visible truth about pre-existing, hegemonic narratives.\"[9] However, an artwork hoping to move engagement away from passivity may require \"human interpretation, not machinic reprocessing\" of the archival material.[10] One cannot simply recreate the archive, but give people a way into it. Bring the body to life.

An artist can further this function by using distributable media as a medium. Multiples act as a communicative action to many, that can physically pass through networks of people, through the parts of the body. Like art can relieve historical information from the archive, a distributable work can relieve art from the gallery, taking its content further. The form of the work embodies its desire to communicate and disseminate information by allowing its own dispersal. The intention to spread knowledge and ideas is given form in the distributable multiple. Blood pumps - veins fill the body - circulating - the skin reddens -  

In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Walter Benjamin saw methods of reproduction and photography as freeing art from outmoded concepts of genius, ritual and mystery but also depreciating the work's presence.[11] To Benjamin, an original artwork holds an \"aura\" and authenticity which is devalued by mechanical reproduction. This is because the \"aura\" is determined by \"its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.\"[12] Benjamin sees the uniqueness of a work's existence to hold its \"aura,\" and this is removed when reproduced.

I disagree. 

A collection of reproductions rather than a unique piece have an alternative aura. They too have presence in time and space, but rather than being singular and unique, it is multitudinous. A body of multiples is intended to be disseminated, focusing on dispersion rather than a singular place and moment of experience.

 The blood of the body, cannot be still, cannot be held in the heart. 
 
Works leave the gallery and follow unknown and unpredictable paths, they will be seen by many, in different places and at other times. Rather than making a singular statement, multiples echo amongst the people they come across, scattering a conversation. Multiples will be folded, creased, marked and taken to other places and yet more hands, or tucked away somewhere, to be found years later, dusty. A multiple then, holds an aura of being a part of this, the feeling of knowing that what is held in your hands, is also held by many others. 

In 2002, artist Seth Price self-published the essay Dispersion, available online as a free downloadable PDF and in print. Dispersion questions the place of art and systems it works within, placing emphasis on distribution and culture. Price critiques public art's \"Utopian promise of... collective public experience.\"[13] He sees the monumental model of public art as outdated, since audiences are no longer interested in direct communal experiences.[14] He states, \"We should recognise that collective experience is now based on simultaneous private experiences.\"[15] Through reproduction and dispersal, content is consumed privately en mass, allowing people to have a personal engagement within a collective experience. The public and private are intermingled as the personal and political are. Through an accessible, reproduced form, collected from a greater body, the reader can recognise they have become a participant, part of a ripple effect. Their hand has taken part already, in the simplest action of picking up, feeling the weight and texture, and disseminating the work.

Even in forms which may exit the gallery, we must recognise the frameworks and discourses in which art resides. Many in the visual arts have attempted to keep philosophical ambiguities of art practices away from concrete social issues.[16] However, many artists are compelled to use art as a political tool, perhaps to justify their own practice during times when there are pressing issues. There is a danger of instrumentalising art when we look for it to have a measurable effect, to avoid this we need to acknowledge qualities of art. The power of art is not measurable like the stock market index, not strong like an army, not decisive like a policy change. We must use \"its subtle power to reveal and re-envisage the world, to develop the viewer's consciousness of the conditions of that world.\"[17] Although art can be used as a political tool, one must understand the tool in order to use it well.

Think of a megaphone, either a machine to amplify the voice of one, or many using their voices together in unison. 

We are a body, we are a multitude.
