    ABOUTUS_SUMMARY: 'A ROOM WITH A VIEW (ARWAV) is artist-run online space open for all creative thinkers. Centred around the question of ‘what is the contemporaneity?’, we curate an online installation biannually. Considering installation is the constellation of heterogeneous things, our installation explores a symbiotic relationship between creative objects. A digital platform dismisses things enhancing and controlling real life exhibitions such as gravity, tactility, geography, the traditional hierarchy of media and a private view with free alcohol. Here we explore lighter, flat, mobile and personal experience of art to investigate our time. We invite creatives and practitioners from various disciplines.</br></br>A ROOM WITH A VIEW is run by Chihiro Gompei and Takako Ogawa. Our site is English - Japanese bilingual.',

    CURATORIAL_TITLE: 'Welcome to our first constellation, ‘MAKING AN ORIGINAL OUT OF A COPY | 複製からオリジナルを’. ',
    CURATORIAL_SUMMARY: 'Our everyday life is full of copies. Pictures on Instagram, mass-produced clothes, music from Spotify and Rodin’s sculpture of Tate collection...everything circles around the world both physically and digitally. It is quite hard to find something unique in time and space in the sense of Walter Benjamin. Is the concept of an original is actually obsolete today? Or are we reterritorialising a copy? Inviting eleven creative thinkers, we explore the concept of an original and a copy in our time.</br>',
    CURATORIAL_DESCRIPTION: 'Lisbon based artist Lise Bardou explores the aura of the city Lisbon experiencing the rapid gentrification. Developing her research project on the processions last summer, she is working on the performance project A procissão das portas de parede. She visited construction sites where used to be abandoned and functioned as common space like a procession. She shares an introductory video work A procissão das portas de parede #1 with us. Ramona Güntert explores a relationship between photographic work and exhibition space, reflecting her research on camouflage and mimicry. In her work, an object and a set oscillate back and forth and the dynamics gradually spreads into an exhibition space like a wave. Questioning the authorship, Tokyo based artist Jesse Hogan presents a series of oil paintings that replicate documented images of exhibitions and floor talks flooding on the Internet. The paintings were presented for his solo show Floor Talks at Tokyo University of the Arts in 2017. Tokyo based Photographer Yuki Watanabe explores the visual ambiguity of copies through Untitled. She photographed a seascape digitally printed on a curtain that she saw in Tukey. New Zealand based graphic designer Gabi Lardies also works as an artist. Her interdisciplinary practice explores the archival system reflecting hegemonic discourses. This time she wrote the essay It is a Body, it is a Multitude investigating Benjamin’s aura and his concept of tradition in relation to the contemporaneity. Lisa Carletta explores femininity in her artistic practice while working as a fashion photographer. Focusing on the criteria of female beauty influenced by pornography, Atelophobia questions the territory of a female body in the society and the historical context of beauty. A London based stylist Bronwyn Stemp worked with Milan based photographer Marta Marinotti for this constellation. They reproduced ‘an ideal woman’ or a production of the male-gaze from the female gaze. A docile one, a supernatural one, an exotic one or a seductive one causing distress…we only have the illusive representations of women yet and we are still looking for our identities. A Tokyo based author Yukufune Ema has just finished her project reinventing Japanese classic literature as a BL novel in modern Japanese. BL is the genre of literature and comics focuses on the homosexual relationship between men or boys, which has a quite big market in Japan today. In her work Since the Universe is Prudent, Yukifune discusses the concept of copy and original looking back to her project and another book. Emilia Pennanen questions the stereotypical connotation of the word ‘feminine’ and through her artistic practice, she reclaims femininity’s original position by using feminine materials. Her new work, Flat Shell is constituted with an image, sounds and elements of video, employing techniques such as copying, cloning, looping and repeating. Intimacy and uncanniness accommodate in her work. Minagawa Yoko has moved back and forth between Japan and abroad. She is back in Tokyo and gives a pasta maker printmaking workshop. Printmaking is deeply connected to the history of reproduction and traditional printing methods require proper facilities and tools. Minagawa takes playful and DIY approaches towards printing as she is looking for the moment that her studio practice merges with her everyday life. At last, in her essay The Topology of Kigo, a haiku poet Gompei Ryoko and artist Gompei Chihiro analyse the uniqueness of Haiku and Kigo (a seasonal word), referencing the discussion of Boris Groys analysing the contextual matter of an original and copy. The essay focuses on ‘Karigane’ or a wild goose which is Kigo of autumn and investigates its contextual transition from Edo period to after Fukushima.',
